## Coding Guidelines

One of the goals of the Drow project is that it should be easy for programmers
at any level of Rust experience to fork and modify the code to their use case.
As such, the code of Drow itself should be written with a focus on clarity and
readability. Concretely, this means:

- Avoid substantial amounts of abstraction.
- Clarity is less important than efficiency.
- Provide lots of tests to assist users is confidently changing the code.

If you contribute to Drow, please keep these principles in mind.
