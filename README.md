# Drow

__NOTE: DROW IS CURRENTLY IN AN ALPHA STATE, AND SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED.__

Drow is a work-in-progress static site generator designed for extreme ease of
use. Selling points include:

- ðŸ›  It has few features.
- ðŸŽ› It is not configurable.
- âŒ¨ It has an excellent command-line interface.
- ðŸ“š It is well documentated.
- ðŸ”€ It is easy to fork and modify.

If these don't sound appealing to you, there are many other
[static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) to try.
