# Drow

Drow is a work-in-progress static site generator designed just how I like it.

Drow's design goals are:

- Provide as simple a mapping from source to final site as possible.
- Be easy to fork and modify for your own purposes.
- Run as quickly as possible.
- Include only the features that I actually use.
- Don't require configuration.

To these ends, Drow is designed as a single bash script along with a template site.
Much of the Drow design is simply by convention, and configuration is nonexistent.
Drow assumes you are publishing through GitHub pages, and is designed to support
that use case only.

If there is a feature you want to add to Drow, you can suggest it, but know that
the preference is for you to fork Drow and modify it to your needs. This is very
much on purpose, as personally I like to have as much control over the generation
of my sites as possible. If you do too, then Drow may be a good starting point.
