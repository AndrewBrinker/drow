# Drow

__NOTE: DROW IS CURRENTLY IN AN ALPHA STATE, AND SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED.__

Drow is a work-in-progress static site generator designed for extreme ease of
use. Selling points include:

- It has few features.
- It is not configurable.
- It has an excellent command-line interface.
- It is well documentated.
- It is easy to fork and modify.

If these don't sound appealing to you, there are many other
[static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) to try.
